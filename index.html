					<p>As a native speaker, I love to localize apps and software into Czech. So far I've contributed to these projects:</p>

					<p>Some of these were hobbies over months, or even years. Others were school projects. A couple of them literally just to pass an afternoon.</p>
					<p>In any case, here's all the stuff I've had non-zero contact with. And all of them are topics I love to talk (or listen) about.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>2D animation</li>
						<li>3D printing</li>
						<li>the Adobe Suite <span class="subtle">(more than I would've preferred)</span></li>
						<li>C++</li>
						<li>Fusion 360</li>
						<li>HTML & CSS <span class="subtle">(a rudimentary example you're looking at right here and now!)</span></li>
						<li>Java</li>
						<li>LaTeX</li>
						<li>LEGO <span class="subtle">(duh)</span></li>
						<li>Minecraft <span class="subtle">(Vanilla enjoyer, for the most part)</span></li>

						<li>
							<strong>MacBook Air M1, my beloved</strong><br>
							<span class="subtle">Spends half of its life as a real, laptopy laptop. The other half of the time, it tends to be accompanied by:</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Dell S2240L</strong><br>
							<span class="subtle">Okay, it's a shitty monitor. But it has an IPS panel and a ✨glossy✨ finish, so the colors are decent! And at around 100 DPI, it works just right for non-retina viewing. On the rare occasion that a developer still cares about pixel-perfect graphics nowadays, it's pretty glorious!</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Logitech K750</strong><br>
							<span class="subtle">One of the very few cheap, full-size Mac keyboards. I actually got it for 25€ from a wonderful person on eBay. It has this bizarre solar-charging function I've never seen anywhere else, but hey, it seems to work so far! All-in-all, I really like this thing.</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Logitech M325</strong><br>
							<span class="subtle">What can I say, it's a… mouse. I basically grew up with one of these (and I really mean <em>one</em>, they're crazy reliable) so when looking for a new mouse, I had no better idea than just buy it again. Big fan of the fast scrolling wheel! (Miss me with that laggy, stepper nonsense.)</span>
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong>iPad Air 3 (2019)</strong><br>
							<span class="subtle">Yeah it's an older one. I don't really <em>like</em> iPadOS as a platform, for the record, so that's part of the reason. But what are you gonna do, <em>not</em> have an iPad??</span>
