				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>At some point, I was contracting graphic design / DTP.</p>
				<p>Currently I'm studying <a href = "https://pmt.hdm-stuttgart.de" title="Print Media Technologies | HdM Stuttgart">Print Technologies</a>.</p>

				<h3>Czech Localizations</h3>
				<p>As a native speaker, I love to localize apps and software into Czech. So far I've contributed to these projects:</p>

				</p>
				<p>I <subtle><em>(still)</em></subtle> firmly believe in consistent, good-quality localizations manually crafted by humans.</p>
				<p>If you have an open-source or proprietary project that should speak Czech, you can <a href="#contact"> hit me up!</a></p>

				<h3>Fun Things I've Dabbled With</h3>
				<p>Some of these were hobbies over months, or even years. Others were school projects. A couple of them literally just to pass an afternoon.</p>
				<p>In any case, here's all the stuff I've had non-zero contact with. And all of them are topics I love to talk (or listen) about.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>2D animation</li>
					<li>3D printing</li>
					<li>the Adobe Suite <subtle>(more than I would've preferred)</subtle></li>
					<li>C++</li>
					<li>Fusion 360</li>
					<li>HTML & CSS <subtle>(a rudimentary example you're looking at right here and now!)</subtle></li>
					<li>Java</li>
					<li>LaTeX</li>
					<li>LEGO <subtle>(duh)</subtle></li>
					<li>Minecraft <subtle>(Vanilla enjoyer, for the most part)</subtle></li>
					<li>Pixel art</li>
					<li>Video Editing</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Things I've Mastered</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>none</li>
				</ul>
				<p>At some point, it would be nice to get at least <em>one</em> thing to this list…</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>MacBook Air M1, my beloved</strong><br>
						<subtle>Spends half of its life as a real, laptopy laptop. The other half of the time, it tends to be accompanied by:</subtle></li>
					<li>
						<strong>Dell S2240L</strong><br>
						<subtle>Okay, it's a shitty monitor. But it has an IPS panel and a ✨glossy✨ finish, so the colors are decent! And at around 100 DPI, it works just right for non-retina viewing. On the rare occasion that a developer still cares about pixel-perfect graphics nowadays, it's pretty glorious!</subtle>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Logitech K750</strong><br>
						<subtle>One of the very few cheap, full-size Mac keyboards. I actually got it for 25€ from a wonderful person on eBay. It has this bizarre solar-charging function I've never seen anywhere else, but hey, it seems to work so far! All-in-all, I really like this thing.</subtle>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Logitech M325</strong><br>
						<subtle>What can I say, it's a… mouse. I basically grew up with one of these (and I really mean <em>one</em>, they're crazy reliable) so when looking for a new mouse, I had no better idea than just buy it again. Big fan of the fast scrolling wheel! (Miss me with that laggy, stepper nonsense.)</subtle>
					</li>
					—
					<li>
						<strong>iPad Air 3 (2019)</strong><br>
						<subtle>Yeah it's an older one. I don't really <em>like</em> iPadOS as a platform, for the record, so that's part of the reason. But what are you gonna do, <em>not</em> have an iPad??</subtle>
