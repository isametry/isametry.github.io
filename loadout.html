				<h3>MacBook Air M1, my beloved</h3>
				<p>Lovechild of the Apple Silicon transition and <strong>OBJECTIVELY THE IDEAL COMPUTER.</strong> Spends half of its life as a real, laptopy laptop. The other half of the time, it tends to be accompanied by:</p>
				<h3>Dell S2240L</h3>
				<p>Okay, it's a shitty monitor. But it has an IPS panel and a ‚ú®glossy‚ú® finish, so the colors are decent! And at around 100 DPI, it works just right for non-retina viewing. On the rare occasion that a developer still cares about pixel-perfect graphics nowadays, it's pretty glorious!</p>


				<h3>Logitech K750</h3>
				<p>One of the very few cheap, full-size Mac keyboards. I actually got it for 25‚Ç¨ from a wonderful person on eBay. It has this bizarre solar-charging function I've never seen anywhere else, but hey, it seems to work so far! It's spacious, comfortable to type on, all-in-all I really like this thing. 
				(If only they hadn't used Arial for the keycaps!)</p>


				<h3>Logitech M325</h3>
				<p>What can I say, it's a‚Ä¶ mouse. I basically grew up with one of these (and I really mean <em>one</em>, they're crazy reliable) so when looking for a new mouse, I had no better idea than just buy it again. Big fan of the fast scrolling wheel! (Miss me with that laggy, stepper nonsense.)</p>


				<h3>Sony DualSense</h3>
				<p>Replaced a DualShock 4 (whose left joystick unevitably went haywire), the most prominent improvements being ergonomy (this one actually <em>fits in the hand</em> for a change!) and USB-C (making MicroUSB officially <strong>GONE</strong> from my everyday life ‚Äì finally). Though honestly I'm not confident about its joysticks lasting any longer than the DS4's. I've been eyeing the 8BitDo Ultimate lately.</p>

				<p>‚Äî</p>

				<h3>iPad Air 3 (2019)</h3>
				<p>Yeah it's an older one. I don't really <em>like</em> iPadOS as a platform, for the record, so that's part of the reason. But what are you gonna do, <em>not</em> have an iPad??</p>
