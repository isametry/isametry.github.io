                    As a vaguely technical online person, it is my duty to
                    force upon you a mediocre list of hardware without ever
                    being prompted.

                <h2>MacBook Air M1</h2>
                <p>
                    Poster child of the Apple Silicon transition and
                    <strong>OBJECTIVELY THE IDEAL COMPUTER.</strong> With
                    16GB of memory it just keeps purring along.

                    It spends half of its life as a real, laptopy laptop.
                    The other half of the time, it tends to be accompanied
                    by:
                </p>
                <h2>Peripherals</h2>
                <p>
                    Okay so here's the thing: I've been min-maxing my
                    electronics for as long as I remember. Trying to find
                    the nicest product for the
                    <em>absolute least</em> amount of money, often spending
                    ridiculous hours of research doing so, is something that
                    has just always made sense for me. And most importantly:
                    it's fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the stuff listed below tends to have a common trait:
                    being dirt-cheap while offering more than meets the eye.
                    Let's take a look!
                </p>
                <h3>Dell S2240L</h3>
                <p>
                    Hear me out, alright? So first, this thing has an IPS
                    panel, which is <em>not</em> quite standard in old
                    budget monitors, as far as I can tell. Second, there's a
                    ✨glossy✨ finish, which is also surprisingly rare! Both
                    of these have the combined effect of producing pretty
                    decent colors.
                </p>
                <p class="subtle smaller">
                    <em
                    >(Ever noticed what all of Apple's displays have in
                    common? Yeah that's right, they're usually (1) IPS,
                    and (2) glossy!)</em
                    >
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then there's the resolution: while yes it's only 1080p,
                    it's also in a pretty small 21.5&quot package. This
                    makes the display around 100 DPI – that actually works
                    just right for non-retina viewing… Which is becoming
                    less of a relevant thing each day, however I'll still
                    take it over a non-integer blurry mess in the DPI “bad
                    zone” (around 160). And on the rare occasion that a
                    developer still cares about pixel-perfect graphics and
                    goes the extra mile to add some crisp icons, it's pretty
                    glorious!
                </p>

                <h3>Logitech K750</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the very few cheap, full-size Mac keyboards. I
                    actually got it for 25€ from a wonderful person on eBay.
                    It has this bizarre solar-charging function I've never
                    seen anywhere else, but hey, it seems to work so far!
                    It's spacious, comfortable to type on, all-in-all I
                    really like this thing. (If only they hadn't used Arial
                    for the keycaps!)
                </p>

                <h3>Logitech M325</h3>
                <p>
                    What can I say, it's a… mouse. I basically grew up with
                    one of these (and I really mean <em>one</em>, they're
                    crazy reliable) so when looking for a new mouse, I had
                    no better idea than just buy it again. Big fan of the
                    fast-scrolling wheel! (Miss me with that laggy, stepper
                    nonsense.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the lack of a better comparison, this mouse kinda
                    feels like the AK-47 of mice – deliberately simple,
                    super reliable, and you lowkey see them everywhere.
                </p>

                <h3>Sony DualSense</h3>
                <p>
                    Replaced a DualShock 4 (whose left joystick unevitably
                    went haywire), the most prominent improvements being
                    ergonomy (this one actually
                    <em>fits in the hand</em> for a change!) and USB-C
                    (making MicroUSB officially <strong>GONE</strong> from
                    my everyday life – finally). Though honestly I'm not
                    confident about its joysticks lasting any longer than
                    the DS4's. I've been eyeing the 8BitDo Ultimate lately.
                </p>

                <h3>Superlux HD672</h3>
                <p>
                    This is probably my biggest frugal project to date. For
                    only around 30€, these are paradoxically the closest
                    I've gotten so far to “real”, nice-sounding headphones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So Superlux is apparently this Taiwanese company, best
                    known for AKG clones and the like. But they also have
                    some interesting original models in their lineup. After
                    hearing some nice things about this brand (mostly on the
                    awesome
                    <a href="https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com"
                    >DYI Audio Heaven</a
                    >
                    blog), the HD672 finally concluded my search for
                    over-ear headphones. There's one
                    weirdness-slash-awesomeness: the earpads, for some
                    inexplicable reason, are made of silicone. Not your
                    usual faux leather or textile, just straight-up rubber.
                    It's only slightly less sweaty than it sounds, but it
                    works suprisingly well!
                </p>

                <h3>iPad Air 3 (2019)</h3>
                <p>
                    Yeah it's an older one. I don't really love iPadOS as a
                    platform, for the record, so that's part of the reason.
                    But what are you gonna do, <em>not</em> have an iPad??
                </p>
